            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>NixOS</strong></em> is a free and open source Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager. NixOS uses an immutable design and an atomic update model. Its use of a declarative configuration system allows reproducibility and portability.</p>
<p>NixOS is configured using composable modules, and relies on packages defined in the Nixpkgs project. Package recipes and configurations are written in the purpose-built “Nix language” that ships with the Nix package manager.</p>
<p>Nix began in 2003 as a research project led by Eelco Dolstra, who sought to develop a system for reliable software deployment. This work culminated in Dolstra’s Ph.D. thesis, The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model, which proposed a novel approach to declarative, functional software configuration. His research, supervised by Eelco Visser at Utrecht University, laid the theoretical groundwork for Nix.</p>
<p>In 2006, NixOS was introduced as part of Armijn Hemel’s Master’s thesis, which explored applying Nix principles to a Linux distribution. This led to the creation of a unique, declarative configuration model that distinguished NixOS from other operating systems.</p>

            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Pros:</strong></em> NixOS provides unparalleled system reproducibility and rollback capabilities through its declarative configuration model, making it ideal for maintaining consistent environments across machines and deployments. Its atomic updates and robust dependency management minimize the risk of breaking the system, providing a reliable and innovative approach to package and system management.</p>
