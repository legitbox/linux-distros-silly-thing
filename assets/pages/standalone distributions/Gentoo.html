            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Gentoo Linux</strong></em> is a Linux distribution built using the Portage package management system. Unlike a binary software distribution, the source code is compiled locally according to the userâ€™s preferences and is often optimized for the specific type of computer. Precompiled binaries are available for some packages. Gentoo runs on a wide variety of processor architectures.</p>
<p>Gentoo package management is designed to be modular, portable, easy to maintain, and flexible. Gentoo describes itself as a meta-distribution because of its adaptability, in that the majority of its users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to the system and the applications they use.</p>
<p>Gentoo Linux is named after the gentoo penguin, the fastest swimming species of penguin. The name was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimizing, which is a major feature of Gentoo.</p>
