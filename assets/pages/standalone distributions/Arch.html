            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Arch Linux</strong></em> is an independently developed x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is intentionally minimal, and is configured by the user during installation so they may add only what they require.</p>

            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Pros:</strong></em> Arch uses the rolling release model, that means that all the packages are always up to date and using the most bleeding edge technologies, and most of the time beying faster in raw performance compared to the distros like debian</p>

            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Cons</strong></em> On second hand that bleeding edge software can break your arch installation very easily, which for that to not happen, you either have to use an arch distro that kinda take cares of that, or be a more experienced linux user that can use these kinds of problems themselves<br>
its also harsh for begginners for beying too much of a “do it yourself” distro</p>
