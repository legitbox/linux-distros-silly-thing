            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Pop OS</strong></em> (stylized as Pop!_OS) is a free and open-source Linux distribution, based on Ubuntu, and featuring a customized GNOME desktop environment known as COSMIC. The distribution is developed by American Linux computer manufacturer System76. Pop!_OS is primarily built to be bundled with the computers built by System76, but can also be downloaded and installed on most computers.</p>
<p>Pop!_OS provides full out-of-the-box support for both AMD and Nvidia GPUs. Pop!_OS provides default disk encryption, streamlined window and workspace management, keyboard shortcuts for navigation as well as built-in power management profiles. The latest releases also have packages that allow for easy setup for TensorFlow and CUDA.</p>
<p>Pop!_OS is maintained primarily by System76, with the release version source code hosted in a GitHub repository. Unlike many other Linux distributions, it is not community-driven, although outside programmers can contribute, view and modify the source code. They can also build custom ISO images and redistribute them under another name.</p>

            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Pros:</strong></em> Pop!_OS, developed by System76, is a highly polished, user-friendly distro designed for ease of use, particularly for hardware configurations like System76â€™s own laptops and desktops. Its focus on providing a smooth experience for developers, engineers, and creative professionals makes it an attractive choice for those seeking a powerful yet accessible desktop Linux.</p>

            <p class="object_description"><p><em><strong>Cons</strong></em> Pop!_OS can be seen as less flexible than more traditional distributions like Ubuntu, especially when it comes to customization, as it prioritizes a specific user experience over broad configurability. The reliance on GNOME as its default desktop environment may also not appeal to users who prefer a different desktop environment.</p>
